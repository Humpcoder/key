# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers.

## Features ✨

- ➕ Addition of two numbers
- ➖ Subtraction of two numbers
- ✖️ Multiplication of two numbers
- ➗ Division of two numbers
- Supports decimal numbers (floating-point arithmetic)
- Fun and colorful comments! 🎊

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. The program will display:
   - The sum of the two numbers
   - The difference between them
   - The product of them
   - The quotient (first number divided by second number)

## Example Usage 💻

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- This calculator does not currently handle division by zero (entering 0 as the second number will cause an error).
- The program uses floating-point numbers, so integer inputs will be converted to floats (e.g., 5 becomes 5.0).

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add error handling for division by zero
- Include more operations (exponents, modulo, etc.)
- Create a GUI version
- Add history of calculations

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x

Enjoy calculating! 🎉😊
